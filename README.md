# GA_robust_optimization
Final project for course, investigating implementation of robust optimization
Uses a variance penalty to determine robust locations of objective function. 
Run by ga_r.m
Update myfun, constraint and object class to customize for function. 

Issues.
No variation to determine variance included in constraints.
